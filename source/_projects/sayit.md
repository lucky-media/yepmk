Participants have the opportunity to discuss various general topics and topics related to day-to-day life. Each topic is discussed for three rounds, and every participant has one minute, per round, to express his/her opinion. By participating in these discussions, attendees are able to improve their English conversational skills and make new friends. Itâ€™s a great method to gradually teach youth the ethics of debate.
