Techathon is an annual coding competition, hosted for the first time during the year 2019 in partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The competition is the culmination of the TechUP project, and it allows high school students to showcase their programming skills. Teams of high school students compete against each other (and the clock) to solve a tech-oriented problem, and they only have 30 hours to propose a solution. At the end of the working period, all of the teams present their findings/solution to a panel of community experts. The panel reviews and assess the presentations, and chooses the winner based on their solutions. 44 students competed and 11 new ideas were presented, with 3 winners getting the prizes.
