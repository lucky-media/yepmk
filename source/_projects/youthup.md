In 2015, YEP was awarded a grant by the U.S. Embassy to implement its project, YouthUp for Sustainable Civic Development. Through the project, YEP successfully implemented a nine-month training program to train the four newly established high school Student Unions of the Gostivar Municipality. Program funds of $31,138 of which $20,676 was contributed by the embassy, were used to equip students, ages from 14 to 19, with the requisite concepts and practical skills to successfully lead their local school unions, strengthen their group cohesion, and increase their social impact as a representative body. In total, 167 elected high school class representatives participated in 6 weekend long workshops, who in turn applied their education to student union activities and thus impacted the entire community of 5,000 Gostivar high schools students. Across the four schools, YEP provided 48 days of trainings to prepare student union members to fulfill their responsibilities as young leaders.
