We are well known as an NGO that is very professional and works on important issues. We believe that recruiting youth through professional projects is more beneficial than organizing parties and fun activities for recruitment. The later is very productive in the short run for gathering people in the event, but it fails to give fruits in the long run when tasks are given to those recruits. However, once in a while we have organized very productive recreational activities for our activists only, to inspire them and bring them close together. This has helped us become more of a family than a team. We have gone hiking, played sports and visited places together.
