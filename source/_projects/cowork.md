CoWork Gostivar is a modern and innovative space created specifically to support young entrepreneurs as well as those working remotely for different companies.

CoWork motivates young entrepreneurs to take a step forward in their professional careers. Members of the space can be from various professions such as lawyers, accountants, marketing specialists, architects, photographers, video editors, consultants, as well as professions that are closely related to digital trends.

The project is financially supported by the Municipality of Gostivar , WorldChicago from the USA , as well as the local company Lucky Media.

The long-term sustainability of the project is ensured by the modest membership that is paid for the use of space services such as private desk, optical internet, electricity, meeting room, kitchen, maintenance, printing, personal drawer, etc.
