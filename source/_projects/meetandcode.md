The aim of Meet and Code is to help build a world in which every young European has the digital skills required to shape their own future. It was co-created by SAP and Haus des Stiftens gGmbH in Munich, which coordinates the grant-giving process, along with the TechSoup Europe network partners. The initiative is aligned with the EU Code Week and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. During 2019 there were 1221 supported events in 25 European countries. We as YEP were part of this activity with 3 different projects, mainly aiming at inspiring girls to join engineering, motivating the Roma community to become STEM students and implementing a competition for inspiring through innovation. We had more than 50 participants and received very positive feedback from them. Our target were girls, Roma community, primary school and high school students, minorities and people with special needs. The projects involved presenting STEM opportunities, showcasing some engineering products implemented by local youth and teaching them how to build electronical gadgets with Arduinos.
