My Future is a unique academic fair facilitated by university students for high school students. The fair is a space for high school students to talk to university students about their university experiences, learn more about the application process, and discuss any thoughts they have related to the university experience. This opportunity ensures high school students have a clearer understanding of higher education, thus feeling more confident in their decision making process.
