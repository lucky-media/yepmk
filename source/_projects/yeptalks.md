YEPTalks is a motivational speaking event for the young people of Gostivar. Every month, a strong, influential person shares his/her professional experiences. The event consists of a 20-minute presentation, followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Past speakers have included experts from the business, technology, and international development fields. The aim of this project is to encourage and inspire young people to make a positive, deep impact in their communities. All community members are welcome to attend this event.  Since the first YepTalks event on September 22nd 2018, each month we have continued inviting various influential people.
