This course is free for all primary school students in the municipality of Gostivar that are 7th & 8th grade. The students gain coding skills by playing with robots. Playing with Robots is not just fun, it's also educational and inspirational for the younger generations. We are proud of the enthusiasm shown by the students. On our initial semester we had a total of 64 students grouped into 32 teams. We have random teams of students so that we inspire new friendships among them.
