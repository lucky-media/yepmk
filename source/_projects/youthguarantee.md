Youth Guarantee is a project implemented by YEP in partnership with the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia and the National Youth Council of Macedonia. This project provides young people with opportunities to attend business-related seminars/trainings and getting employed. The aim of the project is to equip young people with the knowledge necessary to establish and run successful businesses. During 2018 the city of Gostivar, Skopje and Strumica was selected as a pilot area, and YEP was responsible for the municipality of Gostivar. On March 2019, YEP was chosen as responsible for the Polog region, with the Government deciding to spread the project.
